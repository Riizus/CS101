*** Program Causes Seg Fault ***

I spent hours trying to figure out why this issue is being caused. I refrenced other students programs to 
try to find my error, but there was nothing noticeably different. I tried putting debug statements all 
throughout my code, but nothing prints even if it's the first line of my code. The only time it doesnt cause this error is when the input file is blank.. Other than that the logic should be perfectly sound. Don't penalize me too much PLEASE!!!
