Files:

List.java
A doubly linked list  with a cursor node creating a List ADT. The nodes data 
is an int and there are prev and next pointers to other nodes.

ListTest.java
The client test for the List ADT. Checks each operation of the List class.

Matrix.java
A matrix ADT that represents the nonzero entries of a sparse matrix using an
array of Lists ADT to contain each row. The list nodes contain Entry Objects (col, data).

MatrixTest.java
The client  test for the Matrix ADT. Checks each operation for the Matrix class.

Sparse.java
The main file for this assigment. Implements Matrix.java and List.java.
It takes in two arguements for the input file and the output file, reads 
through the input file to create two matrices, A and B. It then outputs to the file A, B, (1.5)*A, 
A+B, A+A, B-A, A-A, transpose(A), A*B, B*B.

Makefile
This file creates an executable jar file called Sparse.
